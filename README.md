Inspect the dataset structure. 

  - Athlete ID
  - Event Location & Date
  - Age, Gender
  - Total Time & Split Times (running, rowing, sled push/pull, burpees, etc.)
  - Ranking & Category (Pro, Open, Doubles, etc.)
  
2. Overall Performance Trends

  - Distribution of Finishing Times
  - Performance by Category (Pro vs. Open)
  - Performance Trends by Location
  - Age & Gender Influence on Performance
  
## Statistical Analysis

### Examples of Models

  - We can use linear regression to assess which factors influence performance.
  - A random forest model can predict finishing times based on input features.
